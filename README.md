# nPuzzle game in CSharp
nPuzzle in CSharp - Form

This is an adaptation of the game 16-Puzzle game. 

The main features are: 

    * The game is a nPuzzle, which means that you can configure it to generate the puzzle in whatever size you want
    * The combinations generated are always solvable. In 50% of the generated nPuzzle games, the combination is not solvable. In this case the always solvable algorithm has been implemented, which means that all the combinations are solvable. 
    * When the player complete the game a message is shown congratulating the player and reseting the game. 
    * You can save and load previous games 
    * There is a solvable combination file in the folder. It is there for debug purposes.
